Firstly, Greene and colleagues conducted their study via pen and paper, whereas we used an online
 survey program completed at home. Original participants were from the United States, our participants were from Canada. Their participants were renumerated $3, ours entered into a raffle or awarded bonus points. 
 
 One notable difference between this study and Greene et al. is that each participant in our study responded to one footbridge dilemma and one speedboat dilemma with counterbalancing,
 creating a within-subject component. In Greene and colleagues’ study, Experiment 1a (footbridge) and Experiment 1b (speedboat) were conducted with separate participants. Our
 within-subjects approach to conducting Experiment 1a and 1b simultaneously maximized the data collected in a shorter timeframe. We also omitted the remote footbridge dilemma. The
 remote footbridge dilemma is similar to footbridge switch, except the agent is at a distance from the workman, eliminating spatial proximity. The planned contrast in Greene et al. (2009) that involved the remote footbridge dilemma (i.e., remote footbridge vs. footbridge switch to test the effect of physical proximity) was non-significant in the original study. Given the tight timeframe of data collection, we chose to omit this condition in this replication to maximize data collected for other conditions. Lastly, both studies screened for ‘suspended belief’ or ‘unconscious realism’ (when participants unconsciously replace unrealistic assumptions, portrayed by a moral dilemma, with more realistic ones). Both studies did this by asking participants whether they thought the action by the agent would result in the desired outcome. Participants provided an estimate (0-100%) as to whether the outcome would turn out as planned, turn out as worse, and turn out as better. Greene and colleagues used these estimates as covariates, while this study did not. Again, these covariates were all reported as nonsignificant in Greene et al. (2009), suggesting that they were unnecessary to add in the model.",,,0.12646942649981,0.500405493238901,0.109954157363904,0.399660494188949,,,,Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,0.00907481435861781,0.00181453574488602,0.00546366905102042,0.00087132557107841,0.995468137866484,signal,consistent,signal - consistent,3.13910684429014,0.107832773203438

Firstly, Greene and colleagues conducted their study via pen and paper, whereas we used an online
 survey program completed at home. Original participants were from the United States, our participants were from Canada. Their participants were renumerated $3, ours entered into a raffle or awarded bonus points. 
 
 One notable difference between this study and Greene et al. is that each participant in our study responded to one footbridge dilemma and one speedboat dilemma with counterbalancing,
 creating a within-subject component. In Greene and colleagues’ study, Experiment 1a (footbridge) and Experiment 1b (speedboat) were conducted with separate participants. Our
 within-subjects approach to conducting Experiment 1a and 1b simultaneously maximized the data collected in a shorter timeframe. We also omitted the remote footbridge dilemma. The
 remote footbridge dilemma is similar to footbridge switch, except the agent is at a distance from the workman, eliminating spatial proximity. The planned contrast in Greene et al. (2009) that involved the remote footbridge dilemma (i.e., remote footbridge vs. footbridge switch to test the effect of physical proximity) was non-significant in the original study. Given the tight timeframe of data collection, we chose to omit this condition in this replication to maximize data collected for other conditions. Lastly, both studies screened for ‘suspended belief’ or ‘unconscious realism’ (when participants unconsciously replace unrealistic assumptions, portrayed by a moral dilemma, with more realistic ones). Both studies did this by asking participants whether they thought the action by the agent would result in the desired outcome. Participants provided an estimate (0-100%) as to whether the outcome would turn out as planned, turn out as worse, and turn out as better. Greene and colleagues used these estimates as covariates, while this study did not. Again, these covariates were all reported as nonsignificant in Greene et al. (2009), suggesting that they were unnecessary to add in the model.",,,0.102236516806848,0.286533185468308,0.027531543734694,0.327819111616745,,,,Cognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009.0,0.00221185696894199,5.30605022686208e-05,0.00587993888905234,0.0213215113223414,0.803093462054745,signal,consistent,signal - consistent,4.05249899931474,0.049029033784546
